== The goal of this program compared to all others ==
 * KISS (don't do more than needed); configurability only where it makes sense
 * Efficiency and best practices (use specialized tools like vimdiff, pacnew_scripts, and automate actions where possible)
 * Code quality & error handling (this is obvious, but worth mentioning if you've seen some of the other scripts around)

== Thoughts ==
 * If you have a bunch of changes in the config, everytime the same package gets updated, you get a .pacnew file and you must go over the same diffs again.
   -> Ucreate patchfiles? (or use git? maybe make a different branch in which you copy your /etc, but .pacnew files. then you can leverage git's merging algo's)
   -> Maybe something for pacnew_scripts?
